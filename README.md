- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpasquale64
- 👀 I’m interested in pivoting careers from Mechanical Engineering (10 years experience) to Software Development and to learn how I can leverage my experience in future Software Engineering roles. My motivation is my intrinsic love for programming, to level up my career, and to give my wife and children a better future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with respect to data structures and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn any and all advice that will help me with my transition.
- 📫 How to reach me: mrpasquale64@gmail.com
- Go easy on me, I'm new :]
